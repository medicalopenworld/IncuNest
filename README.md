# 🌍 IncuNest — Open-Source Neonatal Incubator

**IncuNest** (from *in3ator*) is an open-source neonatal incubator designed for hospitals with limited resources.  
Its mission is to reduce neonatal mortality worldwide by providing an accessible, reliable, and locally replicable medical device.

---

## 🩺 Background and Motivation

Every year, over **1.5 million premature babies** die because they don’t have access to an incubator.  
Commercial incubators can cost more than **€35,000**, making them unaffordable in many low-income regions.

**IncuNest** was created as a **low-cost (≈ €350 in components)**, **energy-efficient** alternative, capable of maintaining a newborn’s temperature and humidity even in environments with unstable electricity.  
It can be built locally with standard tools and commonly available materials.

The project is developed and maintained by the NGO [**Medical Open World**](https://medicalopenworld.org/, recipient of the **2025 Princess of Girona Social Award**.  
To date, more than **200 incubators have been installed across 30 countries**, saving thousands of newborn lives.
